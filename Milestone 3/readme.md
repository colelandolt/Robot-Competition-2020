# Milestone 3

## Attempt 1

I began by inserting ballistic functions for turning right and left.

The robot handles the ninety degree turns well, but could've executed the turns
slightly faster and smoother.

## Attempt 2

I changed the turning functions so that they would reactive to
the sensor's feedback.

The robot makes much sharper turns. This seems to be a better approach to
turning than the ballistic counterpart. However, incorporating both may be
the most efficient solution.

## Attempt 3

I tried blending both methods together, resulting in a hybrid function.

This turning strategy clearly outperforms the previous two, as it turns
smoother and faster over all.
