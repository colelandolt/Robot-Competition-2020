# Milestone 5

# Attempt 1

I implemented the Left-Turn only solution to solving the maze. My floor is black
in some places, however, so I had to put ripped up white index cards in places
in the maze where the robot confused the floor for elecric tape. After a couple of
adjustments to the maze itself, the code worked perfectly fine.
